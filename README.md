## run locally

### manually

Everything must be started manually, which is the most efficient way to run then specs _when actively developing_ a service or other part.

```shell
export LEIHS_HTTP_PORT='3200' # must match reverse proxy!
export LEIHS_HOST_PORT_POSTGRES='5432'
export LEIHS_DATABASE_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/leihs_test?max-pool-size=5"
export LEIHS_MAIL_FAKE_SMTP_SERVER_PORT='4465'
export LEIHS_MAIL_FAKE_SMTP_SERVER_POP3_PORT='4995'
export LEIHS_MAIL_SMTP_PORT=4465
export LEIHS_MAIL_POP3_PORT=4995

# make sure to set correct Firefox Path
export FIREFOX_ESR_60_PATH="/Applications/Firefox ESR 60.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin"

./scripts/start-reverse-proxy.sh

# start other needed services (look up Cider-CI config)

bundle exec rspec ./spec
```

### using Vagrant

Takes the most (compute) time, but the least manual work.
Does a full production-like deploy into a local VM, then run tests against it.

expose ports from inside VM/container on host machine:

```shell
# those are the default values:
export LEIHS_HTTP_PORT='10080'
export LEIHS_HTTP_PORTS='10443'
export LEIHS_HOST_PORT_POSTGRES='10054' # DB backdoor for automated testing only
export LEIHS_HOST_PORT_SSH='2200' # for vagrant ssh into guest
# make sure to set correct Firefox Path
export FIREFOX_ESR_60_PATH="/Applications/Firefox ESR 60.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin"
```

NOTE: only works if checked out as part of [superproject][leihs]!

```shell
bundle install
vagrant up
./scripts/deploy-to-vagrant.sh
./scripts/ansible-to-vagrant.sh stop_play.yml
# `vagrant reload` if the following command does not work
vagrant ssh -- 'sudo sh /vagrant/scripts/config-postgres-for-vagrant.sh'
./scripts/ansible-to-vagrant.sh start_play.yml
until curl -k --fail -s https://localhost:${LEIHS_HTTP_PORTS}; do sleep 3; done
bundle exec rspec ./spec
```

## Status Integration Testing on Cider-CI

as of 2019-04-02:

- all services are integrated and used very much like in the deployment case
- main reverse proxy configuration uses the template from deployment!
- 11 out of 17 tests are green
- we use S3 storage for uberjars, and checked in assets for `my`

### DONE

- get all running

- `my` and very much `procurement` have been alinged with general strategy: one
  independent uberjar

- in git check-ed builds vs S3 storage evaluated; both work;

  - in git checked in builds

    - are a bit anyoing for the developer

    - the uberjars would be too big;

  - S3 works

    - well from the CI scripting and usage point

    - the "ad hoc" used S3 technology `Minio` is neither flexible enaugh nor
      reliable, would need to try Ceph

### TODO:

- Assets handling in `my` service needs to be finished

- deploy needs to be adjusted: changed building and service handling; but
  generally be simpler and more similar among services

- get tests green

- continue with S3 (?, depends on Ceph), or check in builds (how and where?)

## Reverse Proxy

### Caching

Prototyping and testing caching:

- must retrieve the whole file, i.e. use `tee`
- retrieve at least two times
- headers should correspond to the browner headers, e.g. "copy as curl"
- we announce caching via header for easier debugging rep verification

  curl -i 'http://localhost:3200/my/css/fontawesome-free-5.0.13/css/fontawesome-all.css' -H 'Referer: http://localhost:3200/' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.121 Safari/537.36' -H 'DNT: 1' --compressed | tee tmp/fontawesome-all.css | head -n 20

  ...
  X-Cache: HIT from localhost
  ...

### Caveats

- disk cache seems only to work with absolute paths
- disk cache doesn't work if the "subdirectory" does not exists, e.g. `/tmp/apche-cache` will not work .i.g.;

- memory cache shmcb seems to work just by file size; don't know if there is any management at all

Whenever something is no right, you will get a "cache miss" and possibly some
"unwilling" note in the logs.

## dev: debug selenium/webdriver/geckodriver/firefox setup

```sh
# start ruby repl
xvfb-run -a -e log/xvfb.log bundle exec irb -W --verbose
```

```ruby
require 'selenium-webdriver'

opts = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Options.new(
  log_level: :trace, binary: ENV['FIREFOX_ESR_60_PATH'])

driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox, options: opts

# should now accept commands:
driver.manage.window.resize_to(1024,768)
```

### dev: Cider-CI traits install (ubuntu)

```sh
# vagrant
apt update
apt install vagrant

# virtualbox
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian '$(lsb_release -cs)' contrib non-free' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list"
wget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
wget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox_2016.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
apt update
apt install -y virtualbox-5.1 virtualbox-dkms
usermod -a -G vboxusers ci-exec-user

# virtualbox kernel modules
apt install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r` -y
apt install dkms -y
#  check it
lsmod | grep vboxdrv
#  => vboxdrv 446464 3 vboxnetadp,vboxnetflt,vboxpci
```
